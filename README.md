# What is Kosaka?
Kosaka is a Closed-Source multi-purpose Discord Bot built specifically for The Sirio Network.

## How do I use Kosaka?
Either [install Kosaka as a User Application](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308405429725958226), Kosaka inside select Discord Servers such as [The Sirio Network's Discord Server](https://dev.sirio-network.com/discord), or invite the `Deferred` Build (less updated) of Kosaka into any server using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1386347044649570324).  
Installing Kosaka as a User Application gives you access to utilities such as the Embed Fixer or smaller commands.  
***Remember to keep in mind, much like my mental health, Kosaka is EXTREMELY unstable, use at your own risk***!

**WARNING:** __ANY TSN Administrator has access to every single Archive and Message Caches!__  
Consider disabling the Archiver feature and also the Message Caches of certain commands such as `/random_message` and if you care about privacy.  
These features can be disabled using `/guild_settings`, read `/help Settings` for more information.*

### Where's the code??
Kosaka is Closed-Source software, this repository's purpose is exclusively used only for reporting bugs via [GitHub's Issues](https://github.com/Ascellayn/TSN_Kosaka-Issues/issues).

#### Kosaka is still extremely early in development, stuff will break often.
Please provide screenshots when making bug reports and especially specify the time (if appplicable) of when the bug occurs.
