#### Starting from an [experiment that became abandonned](https://github.com/Ascellayn/TSN_Kosaka-OLD), for it to finally get the love it deserved...
### Kosaka is now a 3 year old Discord Bot.
And boy is it FINALLY useful and got some real use cases.

<br>
<br>

# Kosaka fixes your Embeds but just plain *better*, and [anywhere](https://github.com/Ascellayn/Kosaka_Issues/wiki/Application-User-Commands).

### and of course naturally it supports more than one website
| Kosaka currently supports the following Websites | ... and will support in the future |
|-|-|
| Twitter (Supports Profiles, displaying Threads, and much more!) | Steam (Game prices history, links to a game's discussion pages, etc.) |
| Pixiv (Displaying Artworks even with restrictions, clickable Tags, etc.) | |
| Youtube (Video Statistics) | |

With possibly way more websites as time passes!

Keep your members in check thanks to commands such as `/channel_mods media_only` and Kosaka's **EXTRMELY POWERFULL** message logger!

# And yes Kosaka has some sillier commands why would it not?

Need the usual coin flip, number roller? Kosaka's got you covered, but what if you're mega bored? Then choose to embark into the distant past with `/first_message` or if you're more of a chaotic type of person, try to pull for a hilariously out of context (and probably very vulgar) message with `/random_message`!
