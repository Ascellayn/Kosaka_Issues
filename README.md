# What is Kosaka?
Kosaka is a Closed-Source multi-purpose Discord Bot built specifically for The Sirio Network.

## How do I use Kosaka?
Either [install Kosaka as a User Application](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1308405429725958226) or use Kosaka inside select Discord Servers such as [The Sirio Network's Discord Server](https://dev.sirio-network.com/discord).  
Installing Kosaka as a User Application gives you access to utilities such as the Embed Fixer or smaller commands.  
**UPDATE:** You may now invite the `Deferred` Build of Kosaka into any server using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1386347044649570324), ***however keep in mind, much like my mental health, Kosaka is EXTREMELY unstable, use at your own risk***!  

*Furthermore keep in mind that __ANY TSN Administrator has access to every single Archive__, consider disabling the Archiver feature if you care about privacy.*  
(Warning: As of 23/06, you cannot disable the Archiver yet, as the disabling feature has yet to be implemented.)

### Where's the code??
Kosaka is Closed-Source software, this repository's purpose is exclusively used only for reporting bugs via [GitHub's Issues](https://github.com/Ascellayn/TSN_Kosaka-Issues/issues).

#### Kosaka is still extremely early in development, stuff will break often.
Please provide screenshots when making bug reports and especially specify the time (if appplicable) of when the bug occurs.
