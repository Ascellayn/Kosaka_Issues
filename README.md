#### Starting from an [experiment that became abandonned](https://github.com/Ascellayn/TSN_Kosaka-OLD), for it to finally get the love it deserved...
### Kosaka is now a 3 year old Discord Bot.
And boy is it FINALLY useful and got some real use cases.

<br>

# Kosaka fixes your Embeds but just plain *better*, and [anywwhere](https://github.com/Ascellayn/TSN_Kosaka-Issues/wiki/Application-User-Commands).

<br>

### and of course naturally it supports more than one website
| Kosaka currently supports the following Websites | ... and will support in the future |
|-|-|
| Twitter (Supports Profiles, displaying Threads, and much more!) | Youtube (Video / Profile Statistics) → Will be added next Kosaka Update! |
| Pixiv (Displaying Artworks even with restrictions, clickable Tags, etc.) | Steam (Game prices history, links to a game's discussion pages, etc.) |

With possibly way more websites as time passes!

</p>

Keep your members in check thanks to commands such as `/channel_mods media_only` and Kosaka's **EXTRMELY POWERFULL** message logger!

<br>

# And yes Kosaka has some sillier commands why would it not?

</p>

Need the usual coin flip, number roller? Kosaka's got you covered, but what if you're mega bored? Then choose to embark into the distant past with `/first_message` or if you're more of a chaotic type of person, try to pull for a hilariously out of context (and probably very vulgar) message with `/random_message`!
