# v2.4.9 Stability Update
Unbelievably even more bloody blessed small fixes.  

# Blacklist Changes
- Synchronizing the Blacklist across all 3 different versions of Kosaka thanks to [Kosaka Calamity](https://github.com/Ascellayn/Kosaka_Calamity).
*This is the start of making Kosaka less of a monolith. Up next should be handling Kosaka Statistics.*
