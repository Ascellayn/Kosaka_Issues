# v2.4.3 Stability Update
Bug fixes that were supposed to release on 29/07/2025 but got delayed because had to modify a lot more shid than I expected. Oops.

# Breaking Changes
- **User Archives were cleared once more, as we no longer save Users that are in the end bots.**

# General Changes
- Fixed ANOTHER critical bug that affected all commands if the server owner didn't have DMs enabled and they didn't have Kernel-Level permissions yet.  
*This was silently done during v2.4.2, but figured I'd still mention it.*  
- Access Denied Messages now have a link to the Kosaka Wiki's page about permissions to attempt to reduce confusion.
- A proper Embed styling guideline has been implemented for Kosaka
*I used to just "wing it" and select emojis & a color randomly, which wasn't good for consistency. This has been fixed.*  
- Fixed missing spaces in certain Embeds.
- Cleaned up unused code.
- Fixed a bug related to User history archives AGAIN (this should make ONCE AGAIN certain features work way more consistently)
- Reworked ENTIRELY how "Scroll to Top" messages work and added a button to scroll to the original message.
- Certain messages should now have working Message URLs when they didn't work if the message pointed outside of a guild.
- Added an automatic cleanup system to avoid Kosaka behaving oddly when she's no longer in a server.

# Core Modules
## NEW MODULE: C&C
This module is in charge of automatically cleaning up useless files that Kosaka no longer needs, especially if Kosaka leaves a server.  
It also contains a command to entirely nuke your User Profile History across all servers that Kosaka is saving.  

## Permissions
- Adjusted the permissions system to be even faster and more optimized.
- Fixed a bug where an Access Denied message would always return "Kernel" or "Hardware" as the required permission.
- Added an emoji to the Privilege Escalation DM Message.

## Non-Essential
### Broadcast
- Fixed bugs related to sending to server owners the broadcasts if they do not have DMs open.
### Changelog
- Fixed bugs related to sending to server owners the changelogs if they do not have DMs open.


## Settings
### Common
- Added Common functions to improve the speed of the commands.
### Guild
- Fixed an issue where by default Kosaka generated the "Allow_UnknownContext_Errors" key instead of "Display_UnknownContext_Errors", causing unnecessary errors.
- Kosaka is now less rude.
### User
- Kosaka is less rude. Again.
- Changelog DM Announcements are no longer turned on by default.



# Extended Modules
## Music
- Fixed outdated embeds from the Kosaka Music PoC Days (`/music disconnect` being mentioned for example when nowadays it being `stop`)
- Certain embeds have changed to better explain what is actually going on.
- Possibly mitigated skipping not correctly functioning if looping is on.
- Removed useless code.
- Increased responsiveness when restarting a song.
- Added "Scroll to Music Player" to the Queue Embed.

## Archiver
- A lot of the code was rewritten to be on par with how I handle anything now, resulting in significantly faster performance for certain logging related tasks.
### Loggers
- Reverted the last change related to updating User Profiles as that caused more issues than it helped us finding issues. (bruh)  
*This was silently done during v2.4.2*  
- The power level the users who execute a command is now logged.
### Manager
- `/archiver nuke` now also deletes the server's user profile history archives.

## Channel Mods
### Settings
- Appris comment parler en Anglais correctement bordel de merde-  
*(Fixed bad English spelling)*  


## Charm
### Status
- Kosaka now displays the correct amount of servers she's in (Kosaka Stable exclusive issue).


## Fun
### Random Message
- No longer saving the cache for a Guild if Kosaka is no longer in that Guild.


## Utility
### Embed Fixer
- Fixed a bug exclusive to Kosaka Stable: I just forgor to give stable the API key ðŸ’€  
*This was silently done during v2.4.2*  
- Fixed regression for Pixiv Embeds where no image would be shown if the only image was animated.
- Fixed the "This post is NSFW" message appearing every time even if the post wasn't NSFW.
- Fixed images no longer being displayed at all if NSFW was turned off.
- The maximum amount of characters in a YouTube embed has been reduced from 386 to 256. (Turns out in v2.4.0 I just forgot to ACTUALLY reduce the amount of characters).
- The primary YouTube Embed now uses TSN Abstracter's String splicer function to avoid cutting short words.
- Fixed Pixiv Embeds just being handled poorly to begin with.
- Made Kosaka react differently to a certain easter egg if the artwork related to her is... Spicy. (the fuck u doin mate)
- Improved how the Embed Fixer message command works to avoid oddities.
- Merged "PixivID from Attachments" to the "Embed Fixer" Message Command.
- Added `/embed_fixer` command to fix embeds via command, useful to avoid sending a useless message.
- Added the new Message Menu Command `Get Embed Context` which ONLY displays the context of the Embeds, useful when Kosaka restarts and the Context button no longer works.
- The Embed Fixer can now be used ***EVERYWHERE***.

### First Message
- Optimized Code
