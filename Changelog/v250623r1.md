# v250623 Revision 1 - Hotfix
Few little MAJOR bug fixes for the "smoll" bugs caused by my smooth as fuck brain. Apologies.

## As a "sorry" gift for these stupid bugs, a new fun command has been added!
NOW PRESENTING `/random_message`(tm)! A completely ridiculous and useless command which sends a completely random message from the currently active channel!  
Note, the larger the channel, the slower this command is, it may take a serious while!

- **Fixed having forgotten entirely to re-enable resynchronising slash commands, resulting in the new commands to be unavailable.**
- **Fixed most if not all commands being entirely broken due to a last second fix to a bug**
- Fixed the URL inside the Changelog Embed which was pointing to the wrong URL.
- Fixed the Kosaka Profile Picture being set as an Image instead of a Thumbnail when displaying the changelog.
- Fixed the `/first_message` command having the wrong internal name
- Fixed the Changelog handler writing to the wrong Config file resulting in Kosaka resending the Changelog every restart.
