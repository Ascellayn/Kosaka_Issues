# v250623 Revision 2 - Hotfix
This time for real small pages for actually small bugs (wow!)

- Added a (default) limit to `/random_message` of 1000 messages due to how unbearably slow it is. You can remove that limit however with the new (Disable Limit) argument.
- Fixed `/random_message` sending a message with a random message's embeds... Even though the message had no embeds.
- `/random_message` now always fetches newer messages first (due to the limit, otherwise the command would always return one of the first 1000 messages).
- `/random_message` now displays the amount of messages and time it took to complete the command.
