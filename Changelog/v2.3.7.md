# v2.3.7 Stability Update NÂ°6
The v2.4.0 update is coming eventually (very soon), we've reached a point where I am forced to update a core library used by Kosaka which... Breaks Kosaka Stable. Hence this update!  
Stay tunned for v2.4.0!

# General Changes
- Updated Kosaka to be compatible with TSN_Abstracter v1.7.0, this should have no impact to Kosaka's functions.

# Core Modules
## Settings
### Guild
- Fixed a critical security vulnerability where anyone could edit the server's Kosaka settings (This was "silently" patched earlier today).
