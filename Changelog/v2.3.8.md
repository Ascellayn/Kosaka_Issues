# v2.3.8 Stability Update NÂ°6
The more I look into old code, the more I realize how broken Kosaka really is...  
I HATE BACKPORTING, LET IT END, I WANT 2.4.0 TO BE OUT ALREADY

# Core Modules
## Permissions
- Fixed a critical bug in the `/permissions set` command preventing it from working.
*ADDITIONAL NOTES: Kernel-Level users can no longer edit the permissions of other Kernel-Level users if they're not the server owner.*
EDIT: This patch didn't do shit, cool. I'm tired of backporting stuff so I'm leaving it as broken, my time is better spent finishing v2.4.0.
