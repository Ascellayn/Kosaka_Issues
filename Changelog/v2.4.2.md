# v2.4.2 Hotfix Update
Bug fixes.

# General Changes
- Fixed a critical bug that has plagued many functions in which due to poor handling of the archive of user profiles would cause most commands to fail under specific unknown conditions.  
*This bug was caused due to a change in v2.4.0 to allow users to not have their profile history archived while still retaining functionality for the commands that require it.*

# Extended Modules
## Archiver
### Loggers
- Updated profile messages are now more verbose, this is going to help us combat a pretty annoying rare bug related to profiles updating when they shouldn't.

## Music
- Fixed an issue where the time until the next song timestamp was broken when disabling the looping state.

## Utility
### Embed Fixer
- Fixed the "Embed Fixer" message command from not working. ... I hope (I have no way of testing this with my current workflow) ‚Üê There will be a silent update if it didn't fix it.
- The Message Command "PixivID from Attachments" no longer displays NSFW by default.
- Fixed regression from v2.4.0: Fixed YouTube Embeds still showing on the main response embed that no fixable URL were found.
