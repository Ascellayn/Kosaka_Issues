# "The Schizo hears Voices" Update (v2.4.0)
No... I did not suddenly actually get schizophrenia *(... yet)*. I just thought that title would be hilarious. Why that title though? Well that's because... **Kosaka has a "voice" now.**
###### finally, one step closer to total schizo behavior.
That's right, you can now play music from YouTube, Soundcloud and Bandcamp! (With more services in the future) See the new "Music" manual page for more information.  
This update comes with a ***L O T*** of changes under the hood in an attempt to improve the performance of Kosaka too and many quality of life features that were long overdue. This update is honestly even more massive than the The Fat Fuckin' ASS Update™️, this is truly a **MAJOR AF** update. Ya don't wanna miss it!  
Also holy shit I am NO LONGER MAKING UPDATES THIS HUGE, HOLY SHI-  

I do apologize for how GOD DAMN LONG it took for this update to get out... But finally, at last,  
Here we are.  
*From Ascellayn, with love and schizophrenia.*  


# v2.4.0 Breaking Changes Notice
The following Data ***has been reset***:
- Archival Data (ALL message history has been lost)
- User History Data
- `/random_message` Cache
- Channels tagged with `Welcome_Channel` will no longer have this tag as we've separating the Welcoming and Departure messages. Rerun `/channel_mods welcome_channel` and use `/channel_mods departure_channel` if needed.
- The Issues repository has been renamed from "TSN_Kosaka-Issues" to "Kosaka_Issues" to fit the naming scheme of other Kosaka related projects.

# General Changes
- Rewrote a good portion of Kosaka's code when it comes to handling IDs, Kosaka should now be significantly faster at certain tasks under bigger loads.
- HEAVILY reworked how permissions checks are handled for speed.
- Removed debug prints.
- Rewrote a GOOD chunk of Kosaka's code in the name of speed.
*This change in particular finally addresses the last standing code from Kosaka v1.X, I've now untied all the commands that don't need a specific function that was used literally 28 times in Kosaka's code when we didn't need to. This should improve responsiveness significantly as that function did a L O T of things since that function ALSO handled the blacklist which resulted in dog water slow performance due to all the checks. I unfortunately cannot escape that function, as it is REQUIRED for the Archiver and it DOES make development easier at times. But it really was way too overused and that's not good having your entire codebase relying on a monolithic function.*
- Optimized how I handle Embeds to reduce memory usage & improve performance.
- Emojis in embed titles no longer look oddly too close to the text.
- Improved slightly how "Access Denied" (missing permissions) messages look like.
- Fixed a bug where typing exactly `!help` would print out a help message that... Isn't the correct one.


# Blacklist Changes
- Overhauled and untied how the Blacklist works.
- **A singular user no longer restricts an entire guild from using Kosaka.**
*The blacklist used to be absolutely brutal, this change has been made to accommodate for larger servers where TSN's politics and code of conduct shouldn't force server administrators to take actions they aren't and shouldn't be involved in.*
- The Blacklist notices no longer trigger by sending a message.
- The Blacklist notices should now only appear once.
- The Server Owner is now notified when their server is blacklisted instead of just being the person who triggered the blacklist.
- Adjusted Blacklist Messages to be more informative.
- Kosaka no longer triggers an endless blacklist loop (monolithic function issue caused the blacklist notice to retrigger forever).


# Core Modules
## NEW MODULE: Moderation Tools
This brand new module will contain various utilities to assist moderators. For now there's only one but the list will grow update by update. It features "`/modtools purge_until`" which deletes ALL messages until *(and including)* a message you've specified.

## Permissions
- Removed left over debug prints that caused errors for certain commands when no permission file was created yet.
- `/permissions privilege_escalation` has been removed, Kernel-Level permissions are now automatically given upon any action from the Server-Owner.
- Fixed a critical bug in the `/permissions set` command preventing it from working. **but for real this time**
*REMINDER FROM v2.3.8: Kernel-Level users can no longer edit the permissions of other Kernel-Level users if they're not the server owner.*
- Added `/permissions list_members`, which lists all server members that have a Kosaka Permission.
- Updated the description of Hardware-Level Users.
- `/permissions set` has been renamed to `/permissions set_user`.
- Added `/permissions set_role`, **you can now set a specific role to assume a specific level of privilege**.

## Settings
### Guild
- Illegal JSON Messages are now slightly more verbose.
- Fixed a typo which caused basically any JSON to be illegal.

- Settings are now available to individual users! Read the wiki page for more information.

## Non-Essential
### About
- Better markdown handling.
- Updated primary features list.
- The time since the last update is now displayed.

- Kosaka's latency is now displayed.
- The Kosaka Media Downloading Service version is now displayed.

### NEW MODULE: Blacklist
- TSN Administrator Exclusive commands to manipulate the Blacklist. Kosaka will no longer randomly restart when the Blacklist needs to be modified.

- A warning is issued when the updated to Kosaka version is deemed not production ready.

### Help
- Better markdown handling.
- Removed the ability to see Hardware-Level only modules, there's no point for you to see them anyways, you can't use em.
- Also removed the ability to see some manual pages that are just... Kinda useless to see to begin with.
- Images are now supported and occasionally displayed.

# Extended Modules
## NEW MODULE: Music
That's right! Kosaka can now play any music from YouTube, Soundcloud and Bandcamp!  
For more information, [Read the Wiki Page about this new Music Module](https://github.com/Ascellayn/Kosaka_Issues/wiki/Music).

## Archiver
Notice, this module has been excluded from the massive rewrites related to the monolithic function.
- The Archiver Commands are now ACTUALLY named `/archiver` instead of `/archive`. This is to reduce confusions or errors when typing commands quickly because everywhere else we name this module group Archiver.
- Edited the Archiver Command Description.
### Common Functions
- Fixed a bug related to embeds not existing.
### Logger
- Users are now archived PER guild instead of globally.
- *Embed edits from the Music Module, specifically the updating "Player" are not archived due to how ridiculously spammy it gets*
- Updated how messages are presented in the console.
- Fixed deleted message logging.
- Updated the structure of User Join/Exit Dates.
- Users can now decline having their profiles archived using `/user_settings`.
### Manager
- Fixed bug related to displaying messages publicly with embeds if they don't have embeds.
- The message about how embeds should show up below is no longer displayed if the event had no embeds to begin with (avoids creating the message in the first place until an event actually has an embed).
- Fixed typo when filtering events.
- Improved the button visuals.


## Channel Mods
- Optimized how Kosaka fetches and automatically updates Channel Mods.
### Media Only
- Changed how the media only message looks like.
- The mention is now silent because Discord is such a high quality app that sometimes the mention gets stuck which is really annoying and may even sometimes send you a push notification. Silly discordo.
- Root or above users no longer get affected by this channel modifier.
- The message displaying that the channel is media only now displays for an extra second longer before deleting itself.
### Settings
- Added `/channel_mods departure_channel`.
- Adjusted slightly the text shown when toggling a channel with `Welcome Channel`.
- Added `/channel_mods sanction_logs`.
*[!] THIS CURRENTLY DOES NOTHING, Will probably do in v2.5.0 [!], v2.4.0 is TOO HUGE of an update, like seriously I gotta stop adding features last minute*
- Added `/channel_mods list_channels`, which displays all the channels in your Server that have flags.
- Added `/channel_mods info`, which displays all the flags set in the current channel.


## Charm
### Status
- Improved speed of the "HTOP" status at the cost of slightly less accurate CPU usage percentage.
- Added displaying the amount of people Kosaka is assisting in total (total members in all the Guilds Kosaka is in).
- Added displaying the amount of servers Kosaka is in a voice channel (most likely playing music).
- Reduced the time between status changes from 10 seconds to 8 seconds.
- Status changes that cannot be applied (ie: If Kosaka is only in 1 server, doesn't serve any app users), instead of waiting on the next loop, Kosaka will simply try switching to the next Status.
- Fixed a bug related to when Kosaka attempts to switch to the Latency status but Kosaka lost temporarily connection to the Discord API.

### Welcomer
- Departure messages are now only triggered if the channel is flagged with `Departure Channel`.
- **The welcoming / departure messages can now be customized with `/settings_guild`**. They have a character limit of 4096 for the description and 256 for the title. Read the wiki page for more information on notably the placeholders.
- You can now preview the Welcome / Departure messages with `/welcomer_test`. This does not require any permissions.


## Fun
### Coin
- Added missing blacklist checks.
### Echo
- No longer requires a message string.
- Messages finally have proper linebreak support.


## Utility
### Embed Fixer
- Optimized how we handle fixing embeds in different contexts.
- Optimized Phixiv link detection.
- Optimized Twitter Profile link detection.
- Removed an easter-egg from showing up if the Embed Fixer was executed from the message menu, because, in Kosaka's words: *Um. Well this is awkward.*.
- Improved link detection regex.
- Removed us confusingly saving the... Message (in memory) of fixed Pixiv embeds??? For no reason?????
*Boy I must have been drunk or something. wait i dont drink how-*
- Removed type safety due to potential variable redefinition bug if there are multiple fixable links of the same type in a message.
- Fixed a bug concerning Quote Retweets (this was silently patched during v2.3.7, issue with a forgotten variable when I updated TSN Abstracter).
- YouTube Embeds now only display the first 128 characters of a description (down from 386).

## Addressed GitHub Issues
This version of Kosaka has resolved the following issues:
- [YT Embed: Reduce description text & add longer desc support *#25*](https://github.com/Ascellayn/Kosaka_Issues/issues/25)
- [YT Embed: Issues with how we get our API Key *#24*](https://github.com/Ascellayn/Kosaka_Issues/issues/24)

*Note: The promo image used that displays the new Music feature is outdated, it obviously looks nicer now. But I can't be bothered updating the image. This update is already enough late.*

I'd like to apologize as well for how FUCKING RIDICULOUSLY ***HUGE*** these patch notes are. I'm REALLY never doing this again, absolutely painful...
