# 1984 (v2.4.1)
Big Sister Kosaka is watching you.  
~~well err that's true to begin with but that's besides the point~~  
This is a small patch disabling showing NSFW images from Pixiv Embeds by default while also suppressing "Unknown Context" messages.  
Both you and Kosaka got 1984'd, that makes it equal I guess. Naturally these two behaviors are configurable using `/guild_settings`.

# Core Modules
## Non-Essential
### Changelog

# Extended Modules
## Channel Mods
### Media Only

## Utility
### Embed Fixer
- Pixiv Embeds no longer show NSFW Posts' images by default, requiring the user to click the "View Additional Artworks" button.
